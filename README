Community Theatre is a type of live theatre in which
many people want to act, sing and dance on stage, but,
compared to professional theatre, there is little
support for them.  In particular, performance are
often done in theaters without fly space or wings,
and generally there is little equipment.

To address one aspect of the lack of adequate
equipment, this program schedules the sharing of
microphones between actors, minimizing the number
of microphones required and maximizing the amount
of time available to remove a microphone from one
actor and place it on another.  Because backstage
personnel are also in short supply in Community
Theatre, the actors can be tasked with doing these
microphone transfers themselves.

The input for the allocate_microphones program is
a text file which describes the activities in
the play to be performed.  The following information
appears in the text file: the names of the characters,
the names of the actors, which characters are played
by each actor, and the timeline of the play, showing
when each character enters, speaks and exits.

When developing the description, keep in mind that
in Community Theatre not all characters will be cast 
until late in the rehearsal process.  Characters
without actors assigned are given to unique, created
actors until their assignments are established.
This is the worst case for microphone assignments,
so it can let you determine early if you need to
borrow more microphones from another production
company, or if you need to beg the director to
assign a part to an actor who already has a
microphone.

The output of the program is several lists, most 
importantly instructions for each actor showing 
when and from whom he gets his microphone, and when 
and to whom he gives it.

The input file for the allocate_microphones program
has a simple syntax.  Comments start with // and
extend to the end of the line.  Blank lines, and lines
containing only a comment, are ignored.  Lines which
are not ignored have two forms: commands and clauses
that modify the commands.

Command lines start with a left square bracket and
the command is completed by a right square bracket.
The first word after the left square bracket is the
name of the command, and the text after the name
and before the right square bracket is its argument.
For example:

[show The Perils of Pauline]

is the "show" command with argument "The Perils of
Pauline".  Clauses are lines of the form
keyword=value.  The effect of a clause is to add
information to the last command.  For example:

[actor Pearl White]
microphone=1

specifies that there is an actor named Pearl White,
and we prefer that she be assigned microphone number
1.

In describing the timeline for the play, we omit the
actual lyrics, music and dialogue, but we describe all
of the other events.  There are defaults to simplify
data entry, but in general everything must be specified.
Here is an example:

[page 1]
[act 1]
[scene 1]
[enter Pauline]
[song Where is my Hero?]

This example states that act 1 scene 1 begins on page 1,
that a character named Pauline enters, and that a song
named "Where is my Hero?" is sung.  The program will
deduce from this information that the actor playing
Pauline will need a microphone.

Later in this document I will provide a complete
description of the commands and their clauses.  Here, I will
present a short example of a show, with plenty of
annotation.

[show The Perils of Pauline]  // name the show

[character Pauline]  // list the characters
[character Harry Marvin]

[actor Pearl White] // list the actors by importance
[actor Crane Wilbur]

// each role associates an actor with one or more characters
[role]
actor=Pearl White
character=Pauline

[role]
actor=Crane Wilbur
character=Harry Marvin

[page 1]
[act 1]
[scene 1]
[enter Pauline]  // Pauline appears on stage
[song Where is My Hero?] // she sings a song
[page 2]
[enter Harry Marvin]  // the hero enters
[song I Have Come to Save You] // he also sings a song
[page 3]
[exit Harry Marvin]  // the hero leaves 
[enter Raymond Owen]  // and the villian arrives
// note that the character of Raymond Owen does not yet
// have an actor assigned.  When the assignment is made
// we will add another [role] above.
[begin sound Train Approaching]  // the audience hears the train
[page 4]
[enter Harry Marvin] // the hero returns to save Pauline
[page 5]
[end sound Train Approaching] // the train sound vanishes
[exit Raymond Owen] // the villian departs
[page 6]
[exit Pauline]  // the other characters exit
[exit Harry Marvin]
[end show] // the show ends after just 6 pages

"The Perils of Pauline" requires three microphones, because all three
actors appear on stage at the same time.  This example is good for
illustrating the syntax of the play description file, but a longer
example is needed to show the value of using a program to
allocate microphones.  Towards the end of this document I will
present "The Music Man", in which I used 24 microphones to cover
42 actors.

The output of the allocate_microphones program is several tables,
formatted as fragments of a LaTeX document.  Each table is in a
separate output file.  The output file names are composed of
the output root name followed by the name of the table.
The tables are as follows:

.activities.tex
	For each page in the show, lists who is on stage, what
song is sung, and what sounds are being played for the audience.
Also lists the act, scene, start time and duration of the page.
This information is used to debug the input file.

.actors.tex
	For each actor, describes when and from whom he gets his
microphone, and when and to whom he gives it up.

.assignments.tex
	For each microphone, describes who uses it and when.  The
microphone operator can use this list to relate microphones to actors.

.csv
	A spreadsheet, in comma-separated-value format, showing 
when each microphone is in use, and by whom.

.microphone_channels.tex
	Names the most important character who uses each microphone.
This information is formatted to fit on the mixing board below each
microphone slider.

.microphone_labels.tex
	For each microphone, names the actors who will use it.  Place
these labels either on the microphone, or, better, at the location where
the microphone is stored between shows.  I have found that a shoe tree
can hold up to 24 microphones conveniently.

.microphone_moves.tex
	Lists in page number order each microphone move between two
actors.

.microphone_switching.tex
	Lists in page number order when each microphone should be switched
on and off.  The microphone operator pastes these notes into his script
so he can control the "mute" button for each microphone.

.stage_manager_after_show.tex
.stage_manager_at_intermission.tex
.stage_manager_before_show.tex
	These three lists show the stage manager who has each microphone
at the specified times.

.stage_manager_during_show.tex
	If the stage manager, rather than the actors, oversees microphone
swapping, this list shows him what he must do, and when.

To place these lists in a document requires LaTeX, a document preparation system
used for scientific articles.  Each of the above .tex files is included in
a master document using TeX's \include feature.  Here is a template:

\section {Microphones}
In general, whenever an actor speaks, or sings by himself, he has a microphone.

\subsection {Assignments}
Microphones are assigned to actors as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{|l|m{7in}|}
\hline Mic. & Assignment \endhead \hline
\input perils.txt.assignments.tex
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsection {Microphone Moves, by Page}

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{|l|m{7in}|}
\hline page & moves \endhead \hline
\input perils.txt.microphone_moves.tex
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsection {Microphone Handling Instructions for Each Actor}

These instructions are formatted to be sliced into a strip of paper
for each of the actors to carry in order to remember his instructions.
In addition, the complete list can be posted near the shoe tree that
holds the microphones.

{\setlength{\parindent}{0in}
\input perils.txt.actors.tex
}

\subsection {List of Microphone Transactions for the Stage Manager}

\subsubsection {Initial Microphone Assignments}

These actors are the first to enter with their microphones:

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{|l|m{7in}|}
\hline Mic. & Actor \endhead \hline
\input perils.txt.stage_manager_before_show.tex
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsubsection {Microphone Exchanges}

As the show progresses, some actors will have to share microphones. The
following list shows when microphones become free as actors leave the
stage, and when they go back into use on a different actor.

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{|l|l|l|m{6in}|}
\hline page & Mic. & Direction & Actor \endhead \hline
\input perils.txt.stage_manager_during_show.tex
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsubsection {End of Show}

At the end of the show, retrieve the microphones from these actors

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{|l|m{7in}|}
\hline Mic. & Actor \endhead \hline
\input perils.txt.stage_manager_after_show.tex
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsubsection {Intermission}

In case we start a rehearsal at the intermission, here are the microphone
assignments at the end of intermission.  This list can also be useful as a 
cross-check during a production.

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{|l|m{7in}|}
\hline Mic. & Actor \endhead \hline
\input perils.txt.stage_manager_at_intermission.tex
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsubsection {Shoe Tree Labels}

When not being worn by an actor, the microphones are stored in a shoe tree,
which is 4 shoes wide by 6 shoes tall.  
Each slot has a space at the top 4.75 inches wide
by 1.5 inches high.  We provide here a label for each slot showing which
actors use that microphone, and when.

{\Large
\input perils.txt.microphone_labels.tex
}

\subsection {Front of House operator}

The Front of House operator controls the house mixer, 
which contains a volume slider
and mute button for each microphone.  

\subsubsection {Microphone Labels}

Associated with each slider is space to write a name.  
These spaces are 1 inch wide by 0.75 inch tall.  
Here is a label for each space:

{\Large
\input perils.txt.microphone_channels.tex
}

\subsubsection {Microphone Switching Instructions by Page}

These instructions are intended to be pasted into the script.

\input perils.txt.microphone_switching.tex

The above template is also available in the distribution
as file examples/Perils_of_Pauline/perils_microphones.tex.
Edit it as you see fit (for example, change my name to yours)
and convert it to a PDF using these commands:

pdflatex perils_microphones.tex
pdflatex perils_microphones.tex

(You need to run pdflatex twice to get the table of contents
on the first page---the first run computes the page numbers and
the second places them on the first page.)

Because you don't generally need to see the timeline in
the later stages of production, and it can be quite long,
I use a separate template for it:

Questions and Answers

Before I present the complete syntax of the play description
file and an example of a complex show, here are the answers to
some questions:

Q: What if an actor plays several characters?

A: In the [role] command, specify several character= clauses.
The most important character should come first, since it will
be used in the mixer label, which has room for only one character.

Q: How do I handle an actor who appears on stage but does not speak?

A: In the [enter] command, specify the clause speaks=no.  The program
will understand that he does not need a microphone, but because he
is on the stage he cannot be exchanging his microphone with another
actor.

Q: Some of my actors have VIP status: they should not be obliged to
share microphones with anyone.  

A: In the [actor] command, use the clause microphone=<number> to
pre-allocate that microphone to the actor.  List your VIP actors
before other actors.  Microphones will be taken from these actors
only if there are no others available.  To prevent even that, 
modify the timeline so the VIP actors are constantly on stage.

Q: Not all pages of my script have the same running time.  It this
a problem?  If so, how do I fix it?

A: An actor needs a certain time off stage to remove his microphone and
hand it to another actor.  Pages are assumed to be 72 seconds in
length, and two actors need to have half a page off stage together 
(36 seconds) to exchange microphones.  If a page doesn't run 72 seconds, 
you can specify its duration using the [duration <seconds>] command
in the timeline.

Q: Sometimes lots of things happen in the course of a single page.

A: You can divide a page into parts, by appending a letter to
your page numbers: 1a, 1b, 1c, etc, or by appending a number:
1-1, 1-2, etc. or two numbers: 1-1-1, 1-2-1, etc.  I used
page number-measure number in Cats, and page number-song number-measure number
in Jesus Christ Superstar.  By default, the duration of each part is the same,
and the total of the parts of a page is 72 seconds.
However, you can use the [duration <seconds>] command to specify
the time for each part.

Q: How many microphones will I need for my show?

A: Once you have entered your timeline, allocate_microphones will
compute the minimum number of microphones, which is the maximum
number of actors simultaneously on stage who have microphones.

Q: What if I have more microphones than the minimum needed for
the show?

A: If you are in this enviable position, use the [microphone <number>]
command to tell the program how many microphones you have.  The
program will optimize microphone distribution for that many
microphones.  Adding just one or two microphones to the minimum
number needed results in more actors who do not have to share
microphones, more actors who always use the same microphone, and
longer times for microphone exchanges.

Q: I have some actors who sing in small groups.  I have enough
microphones for them, but I want a single slider on the mixing
board which controls their volume, in addition to an individual
slider for each actor.  How do I do this?

A: First, you will need a relatively modern mixing board which
allows several microphones to be routed through a common volume
control slider before they are sent to the speakers.  You can
then use the group=<name> clauses to specify that certain microphones
are in the designated groups.  You can specify a default group
for a character, and override that whenever the character
enters or begins speaking.  The group name is shown in the
microphone switching section, so you will know into which group
to place each microphone.  You can then assign a volume slider
to each group that you use.

Q: How do I deal with last-minute changes?

A: Once all the parts are cast, actors can start rehearsing with
microphones, to practice the exchanges.  You may find that some
actors are on stage at unexpected times, for example as part of
the chorus, and that makes some exchanges impractical.  You can
deal with this by modifying the timeline, but this may cause large
changes in the microphone assignments, and you don't want that if
the actors have already learned who their exchange partners are.
Add the existing microphone assignments to the [actor] commands as 
pre-allocations to prevent arbitrary reassignments.  However,
actors should be told when they first rehearse with microphones
that problems found during that rehearsal might result in changes
in the assignments.

Q: The program is doing something wrong, but I can't figure out
how it is failing.

A: I encountered this problem often in development.  You can specify
an additional output file using --trace <file name> which receives
lots of information about how the program is processing its input
file.  Use that file for insight on the internal processing.

Q: What other programs must I install to use this program?

A: You will need Python, version 3 or later, and LaTeX.
With the Ubuntu and Fedora distributions of GNU/Linux,
Python is a standard part of the distribution.
LaTeX and the fonts it needs are also available from the
distribution's package manager.

Q: How do I install the program on my computer?

A: allocate_microphones uses the customary procedure for
installing an application: download the compressed tar file,
uncompress it, use tar to expand it into a subdirectory,
cd into that subdirectory, ./configure, make, sudo make install.
Details are in the INSTALL file.

Q: After I install it, how can I be sure it will work?

A: While in the installation subdirectory, use make check
to process the example shows.  Look in the subdirectories
of the examples directory for the resulting pdf files,
and make sure they print correctly.

Semantic Notes

Assigning an actor a microphone does not guarantee that it will not
be taken away if there are no others available.

Actors early in the actor list have priority over those below them
for keeping their microphones.

To facilitate use during early rehearsals, not all characters need
to be cast.  If a character enters who is unknown, the character is
added to the character list.  If the actor who is to play a character
is not specified, a unique actor named "Uncast #<number>" is
added to the actor list.  As the show is cast the acual actors
and their rolls can be added and the program re-run to improve 
microphone assignments.  Uncast parts are assumed played by unique 
actors, which is the worst case for allocating microphones.

An actor needs to be off-stage for a minimum of 36 seconds to remove
his microphone.  Likewise, an actor needs to be off-stage for a
minimum of 36 seconds to don his microphone.  The program tries to
have actors don microphones before the show starts and remove them
when it ends, when possible.  When this is not possible, preference
is given to exchanging microphones during intermission.  When this
is also insufficient, microphones are exchanged when actors are
off-stage.  Even in this case, actors will generally keep their
microphones, loaning them to other actors when necessary.

Extended Example

Here is a complete example from a show complex enough to need
the services of this program.  The Amherst PTA produced Merideth
Wilson's "The Music Man" in April of 2011.  We had 42 actors who
needed microphones, but the theatre could support only 24 microphones.
Early in rehearsal the music director asked people to volunteer 
for the 11 solo parts in Wells Fargo Wagon.  To encourage
volunteers I promised that everyone would get a microphone.
That promise led to the writing of this program.

Notice that the first 12 microphones are pre-allocated to the
principals.  The quartet and the featured pick-a-little ladies
are kept together to make operating their mute buttons easier,
and Eulalie is adjacent to both her husband and the featured
pick-a-little ladies.  Assigning a microphone to Mrs. Paroo
was done at the last minute, since the actress was unable to
share a microphone because of her wig.

The program allocate_microphones is distributed
using the Autotools package.  See the INSTALL file
for details.  The package uses AM_MAINTAINER_MODE,
so if you update the package to use a later
version of the Autotools software, you will need
to use --enable-maintainer-mode when running
the configure script.

The program allocate_microphones was written by 
John Sauter in early 2011 to support the Amherst
PTA production of The Music Man.  John Sauter's
