If an actor is playing two characters who are on stage at the same time
but are in different groups, there is confusion about which group the
microphone should be in when each character speaks.

The data is correct in on_stage, but when constructing microphone_log we
keep the group of only the last character seen.  I think we need to remove
group information from actors and remember it only in characters.  This
applies also to character_log, which is built from microphone_log.
